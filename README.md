Roll A Ball Unity Tutorial

We are meeting Wednesday mornings to learn Unity stuff. This is the first tutorial we are going through. It doesn't follow exactly what is in the tutorial because we always find things to sidetrack ourselves with. What if we could....

To make this work download the latest version of Unity (2017.1.1f1) and open this project's main folder. Once in the game choose File Open Scene and choose the MiniGame scene.
